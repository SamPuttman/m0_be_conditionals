# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
   
   It is useful in situations where we want to compare the state or value of a variable and run code depending on the state.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
   
   I think I overcomplicated the dog/puppy question. I would probably try to find a simpler solution but I was having fun with it.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
   
   I was initially worried that I would have to map out conditionals on paper before writing them into code, but it turns out that I was able to visualize it just fine. That is a wonderful feeling.
